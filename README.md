Very simple, put in the shape keys you want targeted, and run the code.
There are some flags that give options:
script_mode                          This is what deturmins what the script does, "F" will make the code search for verts while "R" will reset verts.
reset_selected_verts_to_basis         This will only effect the Reset mode. This will make the code ignore both lists and reset the selected vert's through all shape keys.
select_moved_from_any_shape_key       This will only effect the Finder mode. This will make the code ignore both lists and look through all shape keys.
use_both_shape_key_lists              This will make it so that the code will use both lists regarless of the actions taken.

Simple code, Hopefully its what your looking for.
